This repository contains the Matlab codes associated to the paper "Validated integration of semilinear parabolic PDEs" by Jan Bouwe van den Berg, Maxime Breden and Ray Sheombarsing.

References to numbered theorems and figures refer to the ArXiV version of the paper. The main directory contains the code for all Theorems and Figures.
The proofs make use of the Intlab toolbox (http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/intlab/).

## Initialization

You may edit initialize.m to point the code to the relevant local directory.

If you do not have intlab, then you can modify the file initialize.m
to force the code to run without interval arithmetic
(obviously you don't get a rigorous proof this way).

## Warnings

Some of the proofs require a lot of memory. This is indicated in the scripts runproofs.m and runeverything.m, where you set the variable 
lotsofmemoryavailable to either false or true.

Running code without first initializing 
the global variable intervalarithmeticavailable 
to either true or false 
(this is done in initialize.m)
will lead to errors.


## Below is a list of subdirectories 

The subdirectory figures contains the figures in the paper.

The subdirectory InterpConstant contains the code for Appendix B.
You can run script_InterpConstant.m to reproduce the proofs.

The subdirectory data contains the data of the approximate solutions
used in the paper (and refered to in the theorems).
This data can be used to recreate the figures 
by running the script runplots.m. This data can also be used to reproduce the proofs 
by running the script runproofs.m (we note that the time stepping proof in fact first generates the data it verifies).

The subdirectory results contains data generated by the proofs.

To recreate all data and all proofs one may run the script
runeverything.m.
